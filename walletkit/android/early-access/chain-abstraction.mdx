title: Chain Abstraction
---

Chain Abstraction in WalletKit enables users with stablecoins on any network to spend them on-the-fly on a different network. Our Chain Abstraction solution provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate this complex functionality using WalletKit.

For example, when an app requests a 100 USDC payment on Base network but the user only has USDC on Arbitrum, WalletKit offers methods to detect this mismatch, generate necessary transactions, track the cross-chain transfer, and complete the original transaction after bridging finishes.

## How It Works

<Info>
Apps need to pass `gas` as null, while sending a transaction to allow proper gas estimation by the wallet. Refer to this [guide](../../../appkit/next/early-access/chain-abstraction) for more details.
</Info>

When sending a transaction, you need to:
1. Check if the required chain has enough funds to complete the transaction
2. If not, use the `prepare` method to generate necessary bridging transactions
3. Sign routing and initial transaction hashes, prepared by the prepare method
4. Use `execute` method to broadcast routing and initial transactions and wait for it to be completed

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete flow of a chain abstraction operation, from the initial dapp request to the final transaction confirmation

## Methods

The following methods from WalletKit are used in implementing chain abstraction.

<Info>
Chain abstraction is currently in an early access phase and requires the `@ChainAbstractionExperimentalApi` annotation.
</Info>

### Prepare 

This method is used to check if chain abstraction is needed. If it is, it will return a `PrepareSuccess.Available` object with the necessary transactions and funding information. 
If it is not, it will return a `PrepareSuccess.NotRequired` object with the original transaction. 

```kotlin 
@ChainAbstractionExperimentalApi
fun prepare(
  initialTransaction: Wallet.Model.InitialTransaction,
  onSuccess: (Wallet.Model.PrepareSuccess) -> Unit,
  onError: (Wallet.Model.PrepareError) -> Unit
)
```

### Execute

This method is used to execute the chain abstraction operation. It broadcasts the bridging and initial transactions and waits for them to be completed.
The method returns a `ExecuteSuccess` object with the transaction hash and receipt.

```kotlin
@ChainAbstractionExperimentalApi
fun execute(
  prepareAvailable: Wallet.Model.PrepareSuccess.Available,
  prepareSignedTxs: List<String>,
  initSignedTx: String,
  onSuccess: (Wallet.Model.ExecuteSuccess) -> Unit,
  onError: (Wallet.Model.Error) -> Unit
)
``` 

## Usage

When sending a transaction, first check if chain abstraction is needed using the `prepare` method. If it is needed, you must sign all the fulfillment transactions and use the `execute` method. 

If the operation is successful, use `execute` method and await the transaction hash and receipt. 
If the operation is unsuccessful, send the JsonRpcError to the dapp and display the error to the user. 

```kotlin
    val initialTransaction = Wallet.Model.Transaction(...)
    WalletKit.ChainAbstraction.prepare(
      initialTransaction,
      onSuccess = { prepareSuccess ->
        when (prepareSuccess) {
          is Wallet.Model.PrepareSuccess.Available -> {
            //Sign all the fulfilment transactions and init transaction
            //Use execute method
            
            //Call the execute
            WalletKit.ChainAbstraction.execute(prepareSuccess, prepareSignedTxs, initSignedTx
                onSuccess = {
                    //The execution of the Chain Abstraction is successfull
                    //Send the response to the Dapp
                },
                onError = {
                    //Execute error - wallet should send the JsonRpcError to a dapp for given request and display error to the user
                }
            )
          }

          is Wallet.Model.PrepareSuccess.NotRequired -> {
              //Chain abstraction is not required, handle transaction as usual
          }
        }
      },
      onError = { prepareError ->
            // One of the possible errors: NoRoutesAvailable, InsufficientFunds, InsufficientGasFunds - wallet should send the JsonRpcError to a dapp for given request and display error to the user
      }
   )
```

For example, check out implementation of chain abstraction in [sample wallet](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectKotlinV2/tree/master/sample/wallet) with Kotlin. 

## Error Handling

When implementing Chain Abstraction, you may encounter different types of errors. Here's how to handle them effectively:

### Application-Level Errors

These errors (`PrepareDetailedResponse::Err`) indicate specific issues that need to be addressed and typically require user action:

- **Insufficient Gas Fees**: User needs to add more gas tokens to their wallet
- **Malformed Transaction Requests**: Transaction parameters are invalid or incomplete
- **Minimum Bridging Amount Not Met**: Currently set at $0.60
- **Invalid Token or Network Selection**: Selected token or network is not supported

When handling these errors, you should display clear, user-friendly error messages that provide specific guidance on how to resolve the issue. Allow users to modify their transaction parameters and consider implementing validation checks before initiating transactions.

### Retryable Errors

These errors (`Result::Err`) indicate temporary issues that may be resolved by retrying the operation:

- **Local Network Issues**: DNS blocks, TLS inspection, TCP timeouts
- **Server Issues**: 5xx errors, service outages
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent transaction conflicts
- **Temporary RPC Errors**: Network connectivity issues

For retryable errors, show a generic "oops" message to users and provide a retry button. Log detailed error information to your error tracking service, but avoid displaying technical details to end users.

<Note>
For errors in the `execute()` method, a retry may not resolve the issue. In such cases, allow users to cancel the transaction, return them to the application, and let the application initiate a new transaction.
</Note>

### Critical Errors

Critical errors indicate bugs or implementation issues that should be treated as high-priority incidents:

- **Unexpected State Transitions**: Invalid state changes in the transaction flow
- **Contract Interaction Failures**: Issues with smart contract interactions
- **Bridge Protocol Errors**: Problems with the bridging protocol implementation
- **Security Violations**: Potential security-related issues

From the user's perspective, treat these as retryable errors, but ensure you log the incident immediately for investigation and implement appropriate error tracking and monitoring.

## Testing 

To test Chain Abstraction, you can use the [AppKit laboratory](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and try sending any supported [tokens](../../../walletkit/features/early-access/chain-abstraction.mdx#what-are-the-supported-tokens-and-networks) with any chain abstraction supported wallet. 
You can also use this [sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/076a3bc9669d3bee) for testing.

## ProGuard rules

If you encounter issues with minification, add the below rules to your application:

```
-keepattributes *Annotation*

-keep class com.sun.jna.** { *; }
-keepclassmembers class com.sun.jna.** {
    native <methods>;
    *;
}

-keep class uniffi.** { *; }

# Preserve all public and protected fields and methods
-keepclassmembers class ** {
    public *;
    protected *;
}

-dontwarn uniffi.**
-dontwarn com.sun.jna.**
```
