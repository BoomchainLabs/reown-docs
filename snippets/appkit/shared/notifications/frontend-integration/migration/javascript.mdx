For developers using `@web3inbox/core` without the hooks, there are far less breaking changes.

#### Managing registration

Registration is now split into 2 steps to avoid the opinionated approach of passing `onSign` callback.

```typescript {3-5}
import { useSignMessage } from '@wagmi'
const { signMessageAsync } = useSignMessage()

client.register(signMessageAsync)
+ const { registerParams, message } = client.prepareRegistration({ account: 'eip155:1:0x..' })
+ const signature = await signMessageAsync(message)
+ client.register({ registerParams, signature })
```

#### Managing Notifications

- `deleteMessage` has been removed.
- `pageNotifications` has been added to allow paging notifications
