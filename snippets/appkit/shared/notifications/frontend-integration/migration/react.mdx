There are numerous breaking changes in the stable release.

#### Package rename

`@web3inbox/widget-react` has been renamed to `@web3inbox/react`

`@web3inbox/core` is still named the same.

#### Initializing the client

Previously, a use of hook was required to init the client and a separate hook was required to check for ready status.
Now, there is only a hook for checking ready status which is **recommended** to be used to be sure if web3inbox functionality is ready to use.
However, initiating the client is now done with a simple function call.

```typescript {2, 4}
import { useInitWeb3InboxClient } from '@web3inbox/widget-react'
import { initWeb3InboxClient } from '@web3inbox/react'

useInitWeb3inboxClient({ projectId, domain, isLimited })
initWeb3inboxClient({ projectId, domain, allApps })

```

#### Checking for client ready status

```typescript
import { useWeb3InboxClient } from '@web3inbox/react'

const { isLoading: w3iClientIsLoading } = useWeb3InboxClient()
```

#### Managing Accounts

Previously, the account needed to be set using `setAccount` and still had to be passed down to hooks like `useManageSubscriptions`. This is no longer
the case. Also, registration management was included in the same hook. Now they all follow single responsibility principle.

- **Setting accounts**

```typescript {2, 6}
- import { useW3iAccount } from "@web3inbox/widget-react"
+ import { useWeb3InboxAccount } from "@web3inbox/react"
- const { setAccount } = useW3iAccount()

setAccount(`eip155:1:0x...`)
+ const { data: account } = useWeb3InboxAccount(`eip155:1:0x...`)
```

- **Handling registration**

```typescript {4-13}
- const handleRegistration = () => {
-   register(signMessageAsync)
- }
+ const { prepareRegistration } = usePrepareRegistration();
+ const { register, isLoading: isLoadingRegister } = useRegister();
+ const handleRegistration = async () => {
+   try {
+     const { message, registerParams } = await prepareRegistration();
+     const signature = await signMessageAsync({ message: message });
+     await register({ registerParams, signature });
+   } catch (registerIdentityError: any) {
+     console.error(registerIdentityError)
+   }
+ };
```

#### Managing notifications

Messages (notifications) function a little differently now. One of the big changes is that you can no longer delete messages.
Furthermore, messages can now be paged. For convenience, "infinite scroll" paging functionality is available, as in keeping older pages in the
returned array.

- **Retrieving notifications**

```typescript {2, 5-15}
- import { useMessages } from "@web3inbox/widget-react"
+ import { useNotifications } from "@web3inbox/react"

- const { messages } = useMessages()
+ const notificationsPerPage = 5
+ const isInfiniteScroll = true
+
+ const { data: notifications, nextPage } = useNotifications(
+   notificationsPerPage,
+   isInfiniteScroll
+ )
+
+ const getMoreNotifications = () => {
+   nextPage()
+ }
```

- **Retrieving notification types**

<Note>

Notification images are retrieved from notification types now.

</Note>

Sizes of images available are: `sm`, `md` and `lg` for small, medium and large respectively.

```typescript {2, 5-6}
- import { useSubscriptionScopes } from "@web3inbox/widget-react"
+ import { useNotificationTypes } from "@web3inbox/react"

- const { scopes } = useSubscriptionScopes()
+ const { data: notificationTypes } = useNotificationTypes()
+ const notificationImageUrl = notificationTypes[notification.type].imageUrls.md;
```

#### Managing Subscriptions

Managing subscriptions has changed considerably. Previously there was a single hook and now there are numerous single responsibility hooks.

```typescript {2, 5-7, 9}
- import { useManageSubscription } from "@web3inbox/widget-react"
+ import { useSubscribe, useUnsubscribe, useSubscription } from "@web3inbox/react"

- const { subscribe, unsubscribe, isSubscribed } = useManageSubscription()
+ const { subscribe } = useSubscribe()
+ const { unsubscribe } = useUnsubscribe()
+ const { data: subscription } = useSubscription()
- const { subscriptions } = useSubscriptions()
+ const { data: subscriptions } = useSubscriptions()
```
