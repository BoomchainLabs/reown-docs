The Swap feature allows users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly within the AppKit modal.
This feature is designed to provide a seamless and efficient swapping experience, leveraging our collaboration with [1inch](https://1inch.io/) as the swap provider.

## Availability

- **Requirement**: The Swap feature is available only to users who log in via email or social login. This is consistent with other wallet features such as sending tokens.
- **Transaction Fee**: Reown charges a 0.85% transaction fee on all swaps.
- **Supported Tokens**: The tokens available for swapping are limited to those supported by 1Inch. Note that the availability of tokens may vary depending on the network.
- **Network Availability**: The Swap feature is not available on Sepolia or other testnets at this time.

## How to Use

1. **Connect**: Ensure you are logged in via email or social login.
2. **Access Swap**: Navigate to the Swap feature within the account view.
3. **Select Tokens**: Choose the tokens you wish to swap from the available options.
4. **Type amount**: Enter your desired swap values. You can use the Max button to swap your all tokens or enter any specific number.
5. **See swap details**: Once you type amount value. You'll see the available quote details as received amount, network fee, maximum slippage, or price impact. 
6. **Confirm Swap**: Review the swap details, including the transaction fee, and confirm the swap.

## Integration

The Swaps feature is enabled by default, so no additional configuration is required. 

If you prefer to disable it, set the `swaps` flag to `false` in the configuration of the `createAppKit` function.

```ts {7}
const modal = createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  projectId,
  networks: [mainnet, arbitrum],
  metadata: metadata,
  features: {
    swaps: false // Optional - true by default
  }
})
```
