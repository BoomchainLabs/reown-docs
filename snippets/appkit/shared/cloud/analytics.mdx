Analytics are enabled by default. You can disable them by setting the `analytics` feature to `false` in your AppKit configuration.

```ts
const modal = createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  networks: [mainnet, arbitrum],
  metadata,
  projectId,
  features: {
    analytics: false // Optional - defaults to true
  }
})
```

Analytics help us understand how users interact with AppKit and improve the user experience. No personal data is collected.
