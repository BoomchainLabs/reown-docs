Sponsored transactions allow dApps to pay gas fees on behalf of users, improving user experience.

## Configuration

Enable sponsored transactions in your AppKit configuration:

```ts
const modal = createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  networks: [mainnet, arbitrum],
  metadata,
  projectId,
  features: {
    analytics: true,
    sponsoredTransactions: true // Enable sponsored transactions
  }
})
```

## Benefits

Sponsored transactions provide:

- **Gasless Transactions**: Users don't need ETH for gas
- **Onboarding**: Easier user onboarding without gas requirements
- **Improved UX**: Seamless transaction experience
- **Cost Control**: Predictable gas costs for dApps

## Implementation

Sponsored transactions are automatically handled when enabled. Configure sponsorship rules and limits through [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com).

## Monitoring

Track sponsorship usage and costs through your Reown Cloud dashboard to maintain control over gas expenditure.
