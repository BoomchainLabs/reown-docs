Reown Authentication is a predefined implementation of the SIWX configuration plugin that uses the Cloud service to create and manage SIWX messages and sessions.

With Reown Authentication you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users using the [Reown Authentication Dashboard](#reown-authentication).

<Warning>
  `ReownAuthentication` was previously named `CloudAuthSIWX`, it has been renamed. If you were using
  the previous class, you will not need to update your code, both class names work identically.
</Warning>
