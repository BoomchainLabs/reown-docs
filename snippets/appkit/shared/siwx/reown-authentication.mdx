**Reown Authentication is our flagship SIWX (Sign In With X) solution** - the recommended way to handle user authentication for modern web3 applications. Built specifically for multi-chain environments, it abstracts away the complexity of validating wallets across **EVM, Solana, and Bitcoin networks**.

With Reown Authentication you will be able to see and control the sessions of your users, get insights and much more. Read more about [Reown Authentication](/cloud/user-management) features in the dedicated documentation.

<Warning>
  `ReownAuthentication` was previously named `CloudAuthSIWX`, it has been renamed. If you were using
  the previous class, you will not need to update your code, both class names work identically.
