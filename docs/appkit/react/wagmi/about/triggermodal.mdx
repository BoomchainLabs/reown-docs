To open AppKit you can use our [**web component**](../../core/components.mdx) or build your own button with AppKit [**hooks**](../../core/hooks.mdx#useAppKit).
In this example we are going to use the `<appkit-button>` component.

Web components are global html elements that don't require importing.

```tsx
export default function ConnectButton() {
  return <appkit-button />
}
```

Learn more about the AppKit web components [here](../../core/components.mdx)
