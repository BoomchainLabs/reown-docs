# Sign In With Ethereum

AppKit provides a simple solution for integrating with "Sign In With Ethereum" (SIWE), a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account.
SIWE is a standard also known as [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361).

## One-Click Auth

**One-Click Auth** represents a key advancement within WalletConnect v2, streamlining the user authentication process in AppKit by enabling them to seamlessly connect with a wallet and sign a SIWE message with just one click.

Connecting a wallet, proving control of an address with an off-chain signature, authorizing specific actions. These are the kinds of authorizations that can be encoded as ["ReCaps"](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573). ReCaps are permissions for a specific website or dapp that can be compactly encoded as a long string in the message you sign and translated by any wallet into a straight-forward one-sentence summary.
reown uses permissions expressed as ReCaps to enable a One-Click Authentication.

:::caution
For a better UX we recommend using One-Click Auth.
:::

Install the AppKit SIWE package, additionally we also recommend installing [siwe](https://docs.login.xyz/) which will abstract a lot of the required logic.

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @reown/appkit-siwe siwe
```
