# Sponsoring First Transaction with Reown Verifying Paymaster

:::warning
  Paymaster feature is currently in a limited access phase and only
  available by invite. If you're interested in access, please [contact us](https://reown.com/contact).
:::

In this recipe, you will learn how to:

- Create a Paymaster Policy on Cloud
- Use the policy in your dapp to sponsor transactions
- Sponsor using Appkit's embedded account

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete and is split in 2 parts.
First, we will be using pre-made policies that interact with smart accounts
deployed in service of [Appkit lab](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and validated
there. The second half is integrating that in your own Dapp.

Letâ€™s dive in!

## Prerequisites
- A fundamental understanding of JavaScript and React.
- Obtain a new project Id on Reown Cloud at https://cloud.reown.com
- As Paymaster is currently in limited access, you have to be granted access. Please [contact us](https://reown.com/contact).

## Part 1: Set up a policy

First, head to the Cloud dashboard and select "Paymaster" from the sidebar.
Then, hit "Add Policy". Since we are just testing, we can stick with "Testnet"
chains when greeted with the option of choosing between "Testnet" and
"Pay as you go".

After filling in the Policy name and hitting next, a chain selection screen
follows next. As all testnet chains are enabled when testing, we can go ahead
and click next. This will then show the Control Sponsorships screen.

There is a [detailed guide on custom crafting your policy](../../cloud/paymaster.mdx). However, for
most use-cases, the no-code builder is more than sufficient.

All that is required is to
1. Input the contract address
2. Paste the ABI
3. Select the methods you wish to sponsor via the drop down
4. *IMPORTANT*: If you would like to sponsor the deployment of smart accounts
on your app, tick the `Sponsor Smart Account Deployment` checkbox.

Click "Create" and you now have a functional policy!

## Retrieving the Paymaster URL 
Since all Paymasters are specific to a chain, there is an "RPC URLs" button that provides all the supported chain-specific URLs.

Select `Sepolia` and copy the URL provided to get your first paymaster URL.

## Testing the Paymaster Out

Before integrating this functionality into your dapp, you can test that you set
up the policy by visiting [Appkit
Lab](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) .

Login with Appkit Email or Social Login (Google, Apple, etc)

Scroll down to "Send Calls with custom abi (Paymaster Service)" and 
1. Input your smart contract address
2. Paste in your ABI
3. Select the method you've chosen to sponsor
4. Add any method arguments in the format of an array
5. Add any value if necessary
6. Paste your Paymaster URL 
7. Hit send calls. 

You can verify it worked in multiple ways:
- In the network tab in your browser, you can filter by `sendUserOperation`. If
  the request payload has a filled in `paymasterAndData`, then everything is
  setup!
- Another way is to copy the send calls result and paste it into "Get Call
  Status" and then take the transaction receipt and paste it into
  https://sepolia.etherscan.io/. It will show the paymaster covering the gas.

```

Here the simulation was intentionally broken by providing faulty gas estimation,
but all other simulation errors would be reported this way. Utilizing this can
help debug where sponsorship is going wrong.

## Part 2: Integrating it with your Dapp

To add this functionality to your dapp, you can integrate sendCalls
functionality using Wagmi's `useSendCalls`. For example, adding this
functionality to a React Component

### Define the ABI 
```ts
const donutContractAbi = [
  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: 'uint256',
        name: 'amount',
        type: 'uint256'
      }
    ],
    name: 'purchase',
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: 'payable',
    type: 'function'
  },
]

const donutContactAddress = '0x2E65BAfA07238666c3b239E94F32DaD3cDD6498D' as const
```

### Calculate CallData and Prep transaction
```
const purchaseDonutCallData = encodeFunctionData({
  abi: donutContractAbi,
  functionName: 'purchase',
  args: [1]
})

const TEST_TX = {
  to: donutContractaddress,
  value: parseEther('0.0001'),
  data: purchaseDonutCallData
}
```


### Import `sendCalls` from Wagmi
```ts
import { useSendCalls } from 'wagmi/experimental'
```

```
// in component...
const { sendCalls } = useSendCalls({
  mutation: {
    onSuccess: hash => {
      setLoading(false)
      toast({
        title: 'SendCalls Success',
        description: hash,
        type: 'success'
      })
    },
    onError: () => {
      setLoading(false)
      toast({
        title: 'SendCalls Error',
        description: 'Failed to send calls',
        type: 'error'
      })
    }
  }
})
```


### Add Event Handler to a button
```ts
const onSendCalls = useCallback(() => {
  setLoading(true)
  if (!paymasterServiceUrl) {
    throw Error('paymasterServiceUrl not set')
  }
  sendCalls({
    calls: [TEST_TX],
    capabilities: {
      paymasterService: {
        url: paymasterServiceUrl,
        context
      }
    } 
  })
}, [sendCalls, paymasterServiceUrl])
```

```ts 
return (
  <Button
    onClick={onSendCalls}
    disabled={!sendCalls}
  >
    SendCalls w/ Paymaster Service
  </Button>
)
```

For more information on sponsoring calls, read more in [our docs](../features/sponsored-transactions.mdx).


## Troubleshooting

If you're running into issues getting a transaction to be successfully
sponsored, it's best to isolate issues. So to get started, first: 

### Setup Environment

1. Use AppKit's Embedded Smart Wallet: Login using social login (Ex. Gmail) or
your email

2. Ensure the code performs send calls as simply as possible., eg: hardcode
the `capabilities` object and remove any extra conditional logic.

3. Keep the network tab on your browser console open

### Ensure a call to the paymaster is being made

Since the embedded wallet lives on your browser, you can observe the network
calls it makes.

If after performing the `sendCalls` and approving it in the AppKit Embedded
Wallet, there is no call to the paymaster URL provided. It likely means
that the `capabilities` were not filled in properly.

Ensure the capabilities object you're sending looks like this:

```ts
paymasterService: {
  url: 'https://paymaster-api.reown.com/<CHAIN_ID>/rpc?projectId=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>',
}
```

### Paymaster was called but returned an error

#### Simulation Errors

The most common errors encountered with integrating Paymasters typically come in 
the form of simulation errors. 

Thankfully, the paymaster provides a full report of user ops that run into
errors. For example:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "The UserOp does not satisfy requirements of policy",
    "details": {
      "message": "Could not successfully simulate call.",
      "cause": "Filtered simulation calls do not include a call to a smart contract.",
      "debugInfo": {
        "simulatedTransaction": { /* full simulation information */ },
        "errors": [
          {
            "error": "executionreverted"
          },
          {
            "error": "out of gas"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}


#### No calls were made to the specified contract.

1. Ensure that the chain ID provided in the paymaster URL matches the network
you are on

2. Ensure you are targeting the contract and method specified in your policy

### Not sure if everything's set up correctly?

1. Confirm a call to the Paymaster is being made via the network tab
2. Ensure the response from the call is not `0x` or an `error`. 
3. Verify the call to the `bundler` (also viewed in the network tab) that is
performing `sendUserOperation` has filled the `paymasterData` field
4. Grab the user op hash (result from `sendUserOperation`) and paste it into a
block explorer that supports searching by User Op Hashes like BlockScout 
5. Ensure the paymaster sponsor field is filled
