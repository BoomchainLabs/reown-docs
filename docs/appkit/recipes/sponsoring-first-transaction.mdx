# Sponsoring First Transaction with Reown Verifying Paymaster

:::warning
  Paymaster feature is currently in a limited access phase and only
  available by invite. If you're interested in access, please [contact us](https://reown.com/contact).
:::

In this recipe, you will learn how to:

- Create a Paymaster Policy on Cloud
- Use the policy in your dapp to sponsor transactions
- Sponsor using Appkit's embedded account

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete and is split in 2 parts.
First, we will be using pre-made policies that interact with smart accounts
deployed in service of [Appkit lab](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and validated
there. The second half is integrating that in your own Dapp.

Letâ€™s dive in!

## Prerequisites
- A fundamental understanding of JavaScript and React.
- Obtain a new project Id on Reown Cloud at https://cloud.reown.com
- As Paymaster is currently in limited access, you have to be granted access. Please [contact us](https://reown.com/contact).

## Part 1: Set up a policy

First, head to the Cloud dashboard and select "Paymaster" from the sidebar.
Then, hit "Add Policy". Since we are just testing, we can stick with "Testnet"
chains when greeted with the option of choosing between "Testnet" and
"Pay as you go".

After filling in the Policy name and hitting next, a chain selection screen
follows next. As all testnet chains are enabled when testing, we can go ahead
and click next. This will then show the JSON policy editor. A [detailed
guide on custom crafting your policy](../../cloud/paymaster.mdx). However, for
the purposes of this quick guide, we will use a pre-made policy.

```json
{
  "policyType": "useroperation_payload_control",
  "policyStaticProps": {
    "contract1": {
      "abi": [{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"purchase","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"payable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"","type":"address"}],"name":"donutBalances","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"check","type":"address"}],"name":"getBalance","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"owner","outputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"","type":"address"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]
    }
  },
  "policyLogics": {
    "params": {
      "key": "callData",
      "op": "callDataToEquals",
      "value": "0x2E65BAfA07238666c3b239E94F32DaD3cDD6498D"
    },
    "ands": [
      {
        "params": {
          "key": "callData",
          "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
          "value": "purchase"
        },
        "metadata": {
          "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "chainIds": [
      11155111
    ],
    "sponsorSADeployements": true,
    "startTime": "2024-11-14T11:12:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

The metadata will auto adjust based on the chains and start/end times
configured. 

Click "Create" and you now have a functional policy!

## Retrieving the Paymaster URL 
Since all Paymasters are specific to a chain, there is an "RPC URLs" button that provides all the supported chain-specific URLs.

![](/assets/paymaster-rpc-urls.png)

Select `Sepolia` and copy the URL provided to get your first paymaster URL.

## Testing the Paymaster Out

To validate that the paymaster is operating as expected, you can test it in
[Appkit lab](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/).

If you do not have an Appkit Smart Account, login with email or socials. 

Scroll down to "Send Calls (Paymaster Service)" and paste your Paymaster URL and
hit send calls. 

You can verify it worked in multiple ways:
- In the network tab in your browser, you can filter by `sendUserOperation`. If
  the request payload has a filled in `paymasterAndData`, then everything is
  setup!
- Another way is to copy the send calls result and paste it into "Get Call
  Status" and then take the transaction receipt and paste it into
  https://sepolia.etherscan.io/. It will show the paymaster covering the gas.

## Part 2: Integrating it with your Dapp

To add this functionality to your dapp, you can integrate sendCalls
functionality using Wagmi's `useSendCalls`. For example, adding this
functionality to a React Component



### Define the ABI 
```ts
const donutContractAbi = [
  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: 'uint256',
        name: 'amount',
        type: 'uint256'
      }
    ],
    name: 'purchase',
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: 'payable',
    type: 'function'
  },
]

const donutContactAddress = '0x2E65BAfA07238666c3b239E94F32DaD3cDD6498D' as const
```

### Calculate CallData and Prep transaction
```
const purchaseDonutCallData = encodeFunctionData({
  abi: donutContractAbi,
  functionName: 'purchase',
  args: [1]
})

const TEST_TX = {
  to: donutContractaddress,
  value: parseEther('0.0001'),
  data: purchaseDonutCallData
}
```


### Import `sendCalls` from Wagmi
```ts
import { useSendCalls } from 'wagmi/experimental'
```

```
// in component...
const { sendCalls } = useSendCalls({
  mutation: {
    onSuccess: hash => {
      setLoading(false)
      toast({
        title: 'SendCalls Success',
        description: hash,
        type: 'success'
      })
    },
    onError: () => {
      setLoading(false)
      toast({
        title: 'SendCalls Error',
        description: 'Failed to send calls',
        type: 'error'
      })
    }
  }
})
```


### Add Event Handler to a button
```ts
const onSendCalls = useCallback(() => {
  setLoading(true)
  if (!paymasterServiceUrl) {
    throw Error('paymasterServiceUrl not set')
  }
  sendCalls({
    calls: [TEST_TX],
    capabilities: {
      paymasterService: {
        url: paymasterServiceUrl,
        context
      }
    }
  })
}, [sendCalls, paymasterServiceUrl])
```

```ts 
return (
  <Button
    onClick={onSendCalls}
    disabled={!sendCalls}
  >
    SendCalls w/ Paymaster Service
  </Button>
)
```

For more information on sponsoring calls, read more in [our docs](../features/sponsored-transactions.mdx).


## Troubleshooting

If you're running into issues getting a transaction to be successfully
sponsored, it's best to isolate issues. So to get started, first: 

### Setup Environment

1. Use AppKit's Embedded Smart Wallet: Login using social login (Eg gmail) or
your email

2. Ensure the code performing send calls is as simple as possible, eg: hardcode
the `capabilities` object and remove any extra conditional logic.

3. Keep the network tab on your browser console open

### Ensure a call to the paymaster is being made

Since the embedded wallet lives on your browser, you can observe the network
calls it makes.

If after performing the `sendCalls` and approving it in the AppKit Embedded
Wallet, there is no call to the paymaster URL provided that most likely means
that the `capabilities` were not filled in properly.

Ensure the capabilities object you're sending looks like this:

```ts
paymasterService: {
  url: 'https://paymaster-api.reown.com/<CHAIN_ID>/rpc?projectId=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>',
}
```

### Paymaster is called but returns an error

#### No calls to specified contract made

1. Ensure that the chain ID provided in the paymaster URL matches the network
you are on

2. Ensure you are targeting the contract and method specified in your policy

### Not sure if everything's set up correctly?

1. Ensure a call to the Paymaster is being made via the network tab
2. Ensure the response from the call is not `0x` or an `error`. 
3. Ensure the call to the `bundler` (also viewed in the network tab) that is
performing `sendUserOperation` has filled in `paymasterData` field
4. Grab the user op hash (result from `sendUserOperation`) and paste it into a
block explorer that supports searching by User Op Hashes like BlockScout 
5. Ensure that That the paymaster sponsor field is filled in
