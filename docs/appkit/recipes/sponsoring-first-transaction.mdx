title: Sponsoring First Transaction with Reown Verifying Paymaster
---

:::warning
  Paymaster feature is currently in a limited access phase and only
  available by invite. If you're interested in access, please [contact us](https://reown.com/contact).
:::

In this recipe, you will learn how to:

- Create a Paymaster Policy on Cloud
- Use the policy in your dapp to sponsor transactions
- Sponsor using Appkit's embedded account

This guide takes approximately 20 minutes to complete and is split in 2 parts.
First, We will be using premade policies that interact with smart accounts
deployed in service of [Appkit lab](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and validating
there. The second half is integrating that in your own Dapp.

Letâ€™s dive in!

## Prerequisites
- A fundamental understanding of JavaScript and React.
- Obtain a new project Id on Reown Cloud at https://cloud.reown.com
- As Paymaster is currently in limited access, you have to be granted access. Please [contact us](https://reown.com/contact).

## Part 1: Set up a policy

First, head to the Cloud dashboard and select "Paymaster" from the sidebar.
Then, hit "Add Policy" and as we are just testing we can stick with "Testnet"
chains when we are greeted with the option of choosing between "Testnet" and
"Pay as you go".

After filling in the Policy name and hitting next, a chain selection screen
follows next. As all testnet chains are enabled when testing, we can go ahead
and click next. This will then show the JSON policy editor. There is a [detailed
guide on custom crafting your policy](../../cloud/paymaster.mdx). However for
the purposes of this quick guide, we will use a premade policy.

```json
{
  "policyType": "useroperation_payload_control",
  "policyStaticProps": {
    "contract1": {
      "abi": [{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"purchase","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"payable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"","type":"address"}],"name":"donutBalances","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"check","type":"address"}],"name":"getBalance","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"owner","outputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"","type":"address"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]
    }
  },
  "policyLogics": {
    "params": {
      "key": "callData",
      "op": "callDataToEquals",
      "value": "0x2E65BAfA07238666c3b239E94F32DaD3cDD6498D"
    },
    "ands": [
      {
        "params": {
          "key": "callData",
          "op": "callDataMethodEquals",
          "value": "purchase"
        },
        "metadata": {
          "contractAbi": "<contract1.abi>"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "chainIds": [
      11155111
    ],
    "sponsorSADeployements": true,
    "startTime": "2024-11-14T11:12:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

The metadata will auto adjust based on the chains and start/end times
configured. 

Hit "Create" and you now have a functioning policy!

## Retrieving the Paymaster URL 
As all Paymasters are chain-specific, there is an "RPC URLs" button that will
provide all the chain specific URLs we support.

[!image](/assets/paymaster-rpc-urls)

Select `Sepolia` and copy the URL provided to get your first paymaster URL.

## Testing the Paymaster Out

To validate that the paymaster is operating as expected, you can head over to 
[Appkit lab](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) to test.

If you do not have an Appkit Smart Account, login with email or socials. 

Scroll down to "Send Calls (Paymaster Service)" and paste your Paymaster URL and
hit send calls. 

You can verify it worked in multiple ways:
- In the network tab in your browser, you can filter by `sendUserOperation`. If
  the request payload has a filled in `paymasterAndData`, then everything is
  setup!
- Another way is to copy the send calls result and paste it into "Get Call
  Status" and then take the transaction receipt and paste it into
  https://sepolia.etherscan.io/. It will show the paymaster covering the gas.

## Part 2: Integrating it with your Dapp

To add this functionality to your dapp, you can integrate sendCalls
functionality using Wagmi's `useSendCalls`. For example, adding this
functionality into a React Component



### Define the ABI 
```ts
const donutContractAbi = [
  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: 'uint256',
        name: 'amount',
        type: 'uint256'
      }
    ],
    name: 'purchase',
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: 'payable',
    type: 'function'
  },
]

const donutContactAddress = '0x2E65BAfA07238666c3b239E94F32DaD3cDD6498D' as const
```

### Calculate CallData and Prep transaction
```
const purchaseDonutCallData = encodeFunctionData({
  abi: donutContractAbi,
  functionName: 'purchase',
  args: [1]
})

const TEST_TX = {
  to: donutContractaddress,
  value: parseEther('0.0001'),
  data: purchaseDonutCallData
}
```


### Import `sendCalls` from Wagmi
```ts
import { useSendCalls } from 'wagmi/experimental'
```

```
// in component...
const { sendCalls } = useSendCalls({
  mutation: {
    onSuccess: hash => {
      setLoading(false)
      toast({
        title: 'SendCalls Success',
        description: hash,
        type: 'success'
      })
    },
    onError: () => {
      setLoading(false)
      toast({
        title: 'SendCalls Error',
        description: 'Failed to send calls',
        type: 'error'
      })
    }
  }
})
```


### Add Event Handler to a button
```ts
const onSendCalls = useCallback(() => {
  setLoading(true)
  if (!paymasterServiceUrl) {
    throw Error('paymasterServiceUrl not set')
  }
  sendCalls({
    calls: [TEST_TX],
    capabilities: {
      paymasterService: {
        url: paymasterServiceUrl,
        context
      }
    }
  })
}, [sendCalls, paymasterServiceUrl])
```

```ts 
return (
  <Button
    onClick={onSendCalls}
    disabled={!sendCalls}
  >
    SendCalls w/ Paymaster Service
  </Button>
)
```
