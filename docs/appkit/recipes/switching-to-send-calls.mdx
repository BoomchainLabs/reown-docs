## Switching to Send Calls

With Smart Account wallets on the rise, new standards are being adopted by Dapps
and Wallets that take advantage of their capabilities. One of these standards
is [EIP 5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792). In short, it
introduces a few methods that smart accounts would support, that enable a couple
of cool features including:
1. **Batched Transactions**: This allows to batch multiple transactions into a
single one that will be executed. 
2. **Using Paymasters**: EIP 5792 has a concept of `capabilities` which determine
what a wallet can do and also what a dapp wants a wallet to do. This allows the
use of Paymasters, which are defined in [ERC 7677](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677). 

### A note on Smart Accounts and EOAs

Not all users will be using Smart Accounts; Some will be using EOAs (Externally
Owned Accounts). These
wallets do not support EIP 5792 and will be incompatible with `sendCalls`.

This means that before using `sendCalls`, there needs to be a check on whether
the account is compatible or not. Thankfully, this can be achieved using
`getCapabilities`. 

An example custom hook that leverages Wagmi's hooks for `getCapabilities` can be
found
[in our lab](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/hooks/useWagmiActiveCapabilities.ts#L22).
This hook is then used
also [in our lab](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/components/Wagmi/WagmiSendCallsTest.tsx#L40).
Essentially - the Wallet will inform the Dapp if it supports EIP 5792 or not.
Regardless of whether `wagmi` or `ethers` is used, once capabilities are
fetched, you can then check:

```ts
if (supported) {
  sendCalls(...)
}
else {
  writeContractAsync(...)
}
```

Or disable the button entirely like in the example above, depending on the
intent. This handling does not need to be replicated for all calls within a
Dapp, but instead only for the calls where 5792 needs to leveraged. For example,
if there is an existing transaction within a Dapp that should be modified to
allow sponsoring gas.

### Sending transactions

For Dapps that are using `writeContractAsync`, switching to `sendCalls`
involves a minor change in encoding the call. An example of it in use can be
found
[here](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/components/Wagmi/WagmiSendCallsWithPaymasterServiceTest.tsx#L137).
Important to note is that the function call data is pre-encoded
[on line 12](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/components/Wagmi/WagmiSendCallsWithPaymasterServiceTest.tsx#L12)
within the same file. This is the main difference as `writeContractAsync`
encodes the calls itself. 

### Getting Receipts or Call Status

Typically, alongside `writeContractAsync` or similar calls, there would be a
`waitForTransactionReceipt` used to wait for the transaction. Sending calls via
the EIP 5792 standards by design does not return a transaction hash by design. 

Instead, `sendCalls` will return an identifier for the transaction which can be
queried via getting the calls' status. In Wagmi's case, this is done using
[`useCallsStatus`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useCallsStatus#usecallsstatus).

An example can be found
[in our lab](https://github.com/reown-com/appkit/blob/main/apps/laboratory/src/components/Wagmi/WagmiGetCallsStatusTest.tsx#L52).
