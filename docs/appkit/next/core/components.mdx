# Web Components
:::warning
If you are using React v19 and global components. Please add, before the component, the following directive to temporarily suppress TypeScript errors until the upgrade is fully supported:  

```tsx
{/* @ts-expect-error msg */}
<appkit-button />
```

This will prevent TypeScript from reporting errors related to global component types.
