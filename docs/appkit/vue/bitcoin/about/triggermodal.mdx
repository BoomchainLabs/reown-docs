To open AppKit you can use our [**web component**](../../core/components.mdx) or build your own button with AppKit [**composables**](../../core/composables.mdx#useAppKit).
In this example we are going to use the `<appkit-button>` component.

Web components are global html elements that don't require importing.

```tsx
<template>
  <appkit-button />
</template>
```
