# Link Mode

AppKit Link Mode is a low latency mechanism for transporting One-Click Auth requests and session requests over Universal Links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with network connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

By enabling it, the wallet and dapp will communicate through declared Universal Links on iOS and/or App Links on Android **even without an internet connection.**

:::info note
In order to fully works, Link Mode requires you to also enable [One-Click Auth + Sign In With Ethereum](./siwe.mdx) feature.

This feature is compatible only with EVM blockchains, so if you decide to included non-EVM blockchains Link Mode mechanism is going to be disabled internally.
:::

### How to enable it:

1. Add a Universal Link for your wallet in the **Explorer** tab of your [**Cloud project configuration**](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in), under the **Mobile Linking** section

2. Configure your `PairingMetadata`'s `redirect:` object with that Universal Link

3. Set the `linkMode` property to `true`:

```javascript
final _appKitModal = ReownAppKitModal(
  context: context,
  projectId: '{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}',
  metadata: const PairingMetadata(
    name: 'Example App',
    description: 'Example app description',
    url: 'https://example.com/',
    icons: ['https://example.com/logo.png'],
    redirect: Redirect(
      native: 'exampleapp://',
      /* highlight-add-start */
      universal: 'https://reown.com/exampleapp',
      linkMode: true,
      /* highlight-add-end */
    ),
  ),
);

```

Once everything is properly configured, and the user interacts with a Link Mode-supporting Wallet, your dApp will receive responses through it.

In Flutter, there are several plugins that can help you integrate Universal/App Links. However, regardless of which one you choose, it is crucial that, when capturing an incoming link, you pass it to AppKit so it can process the request.

```javascript
void _onLinkCaptured(String link) async {
  await _appKitModal.dispatchEnvelope(link);
}
```

### Platform specifics:

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="w3m_flutter"
	activeOptions={["ios","android"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="ios">

1. Ensure that you handle incoming Universal Links in the appropriate methods of `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`.
2. Ensure that you have enabled the Associated Domains Capability in your XCode project and that your Universal Link is properly configured. _(Depending on the previous states of your Provisioning Profiles it may be necessary to update or create new ones)_
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">

  <key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>
  <array>
    <string>applinks:your_dapp_universal_link.com</string>
  </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```
3. Update/Create your domain's `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` file accordingly.

</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="android">

1. Ensure that you handle incoming App Links in your Activity's `onCreate` method and in `onNewIntent` callback.
2. Ensure that your App Link is properly configured in your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file with the `autoVerify` set to `true`:
```xml
<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />

  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />

  <data android:scheme="https" />
  <data android:host="your_wallet_universal_link.com" />
  <data android:pathPattern="/open" />
</intent-filter>
```
3. Update/Create your domains's `.well-known/assetlinks.json` file accordingly
