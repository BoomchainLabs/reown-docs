# Flutter

With AppKit Flutter, you can easily let people interact with multiple EVM compatible wallets and blockchains.

Let's get started with the installation and configuration!

## Installation

1.  - Add `reown_appkit` as dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get` (check out the [latest version](https://pub.dev/packages/reown_appkit/install))
    - Or simply run `flutter pub add reown_appkit`
2.  - Locate your `/ios/Podfile` file and add the following as the first line:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

3.  - Run `$ pod install` inside `/ios` folder.
4.  - You should now be able to run your app with `flutter run --dart-define=PROJECT_ID={your_project_id}`

### Enable Installed Wallet Detection

To enable AppKit to detect installed wallets on the device, you need to make specific changes to the native sides of the project.

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="appkit_flutter"
	activeOptions={["ios","android"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="ios">

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4. Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/modal/ios/Runner/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>metamask</string>
  <string>trust</string>
  <string>safe</string>
  <string>rainbow</string>
  <!-- Add other wallet schemes names here -->
</array>
```

</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="android">

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add your `<queries>...</queries>` schemes outside of `<application />` scope.
3. Refer to [Android Specs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/queries-element) for more information.

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <queries>
        <package android:name="io.metamask"/>
        <package android:name="com.wallet.crypto.trustapp"/>
        <package android:name="io.gnosis.safe"/>
        <package android:name="me.rainbow"/>
        <!-- Add other wallet schemes names here -->
    </queries>

    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

</PlatformTabItem>
</PlatformTabs>

### Enable Coinbase Wallet

Coinbase Wallet does not use the WalletConnect protocol for communication between the dApp and the wallet. 

This means that pairing topic, session topic, session events and other session-related features are not available when connecting to Coinbase Wallet.

However, you can still enable it to seamlessly connect with your dApp with these additional steps.

If you still want to support it, on your iOS and Android native side make the following changes:

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="appkit_flutter"
	activeOptions={["ios","android"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="ios">

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Include `<string>cbwallet</string>` scheme as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>cbwallet</string>
  <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
</array>
```

4. Make sure pods are installed, otherwise run `pod install` inside your `/ios` folder.
5. Open your `/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file with Xcode and add the following code in `AppDelegate.swift` file:

```swift
import CoinbaseWalletSDK
```

```swift
override func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
      if (CoinbaseWalletSDK.isConfigured == true) {
        if (try? CoinbaseWalletSDK.shared.handleResponse(url)) == true {
            return true
        }
      }
    }

    return super.application(app, open: url, options: options)
}

override func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
      if (CoinbaseWalletSDK.isConfigured == true) {
        if let url = userActivity.webpageURL,
            (try? CoinbaseWalletSDK.shared.handleResponse(url)) == true {
            return true
        }
      }
    }

    return super.application(application, continue: userActivity, restorationHandler: restorationHandler)
}
```

Checkout out the [AppDelegate.swift](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/master/packages/reown_appkit/example/modal/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) file from our sample dapp for reference.

</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="android">

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add `<package android:name="org.toshi"/>` scheme inside `<queries>...</queries>` as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <queries>
        <package android:name="org.toshi"/>
        <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
    </queries>

    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

</PlatformTabItem>
</PlatformTabs>


### Disable Coinbase Wallet

Coinbase Wallet is enabled by default even if, in order to function properly, a few steps has to be done as described in the previous section. However, if you don't want to include/support Coinbase Wallet on your app you just need to pass Coinbase Wallet id `fd20dc426fb37566d803205b19bbc1d4096b248ac04548e3cfb6b3a38bd033aa` to [excludedWalletIds](./options#excludedwalletids) options Array.


### Phantom Wallet

:::caution important note
Phantom Wallet support is available from `reown_appkit: ^1.4.0-beta01` and is currently in beta. Any feedback is appreciated.
:::

Phantom Wallet does not use the WalletConnect protocol for communication between the dApp and the wallet, instead it provides an internal API mechanism based on deep/universal links.

This means that pairing topic, session topic, session events and other session-related features are not available when connecting to Phantom Wallet and the interation is really basic. Dapp sends a request, Phantom Wallet responds. That's all.

Furthermore, Phantom Wallet  deep/universal links mechanism supports interaction only with Solana blockchain.

In order to support Phantom Wallet interactions a few extra steps has to be performed, only if you haven't implemented [Link Mode](./link-mode.mdx) already.

1. First, be sure you already have your redirection back configuration properly set in place. See [Redirect to your dApp](./usage#redirect-to-your-dapp)
2. Then, you will have to implement platform specific steps in order to be able to catch Phantom Wallet callback links. See [Link Mode Platform specific steps](./link-mode#platform-specifics)
3. Finally, you will have to implement your own Depp Link mechanis on Flutter side and when a link is received through it, you just call `await _appKitModal.dispatchEnvelope(link);`
    
    As an example you can see how we do it on our Sample Dapp by follwoing...
    - [Android's platform specific code](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/dapp/MainActivity.kt)
    - [iOS's platform specific code](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift)
    - [Dart's specific code](https://github.com/reown-com/reown_flutter/blob/develop/packages/reown_appkit/example/base/lib/utils/deep_link_handler.dart)
