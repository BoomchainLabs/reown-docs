# Chain Abstraction

:::note
ðŸ’¡ Chain Abstraction is currently in experimental phase. 
:::

Chain Abstraction in WalletKit enables users with stablecoins on any network to spend them on-the-fly on a different network. Our Chain Abstraction solution provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate this complex functionality using WalletKit.

For example, when an app requests a 100 USDC payment on Base network but the user only has USDC on Arbitrum, WalletKit offers methods to detect this mismatch, generate necessary transactions, track the cross-chain transfer, and complete the original transaction after bridging finishes.


## How It Works

:::note
Apps need to pass `gas` as null, while sending a transaction to allow proper gas estimation by the wallet. Refer to this [guide](../../../appkit/next/experimental/chain-abstraction.mdx) for more details.
:::

When an app sends a transaction request to your wallet, you need to:
1. Check if the required chain has enough funds to complete the transaction or not
2. If not, use the `prepare` method to generate necessary bridging transactions
3. Check the status of the bridging transactions and wait for them to be completed
4. Once the bridging transactions are completed, execute the initial transaction

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete flow of a chain abstraction operation, from the initial dapp request to the final transaction confirmation

## Methods

:::note
Make sure you are using canary version of `@reown/walletkit` and `@walletconnect/react-native-compat`
:::

Following are the methods from WalletKit that you will use in implementing chain abstraction.

### Prepare 

This method checks if a transaction requires additional bridging transactions beforehand.

```typescript
public prepare(params: {
  transaction: ChainAbstractionTypes.Transaction;
}): Promise<ChainAbstractionTypes.CanFulfilResponse>;
```

### Status 

Helper method used to check the fulfilment status of a bridging operation.

```typescript
public abstract status(params: {
  fulfilmentId: string;
}): Promise<ChainAbstractionTypes.FulfilmentStatusResponse>;
```

### Usage

When your wallet receives an `eth_sendTransaction` request, first check if chain abstraction is needed using the `prepare` method, if it is, you need to sign all the fulfilment transactions and broadcast them in parallel. 
After that, you need to call the `status` method to check the status of the fulfillment operation. 

If the operation is successful, you need to broadcast the initial transaction and await for the transaction hash and receipt. 
If the operation is not successful, you need to send the JsonRpcError to the dapp and display the error to the user. 

```typescript
walletkit.on("session_request", async (event) => {
  const {
    id,
    topic,
    params: { request, chainId },
  } = event;

  if (request.method === "eth_sendTransaction") {
    const originalTransaction = request.params[0];
    
    // Check if bridging transactions are required
    const prepareResponse = await wallet.prepare({
      transaction: {
        ...originalTransaction,
        chainId,
      },
    });

    if (prepareResponse.status === "error") {
      // Display error to user and respond to dapp
      await wallet.respondSessionRequest({
        topic,
        response: formatJsonRpcResult(id, prepareResponse.reason),
      });
      return;
    }

    if (prepareResponse.status === "available") {
      const { transactions, funding, fulfilmentId, checkIn } = prepareResponse.data;

      // Display bridging information to user
      // Once approved, execute bridging transactions
      for (const transaction of transactions) {
        const signedTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);
        await wallet.sendTransaction(signedTransaction);
      }
      // await for the completed fulfilment status 
      await statusResult = await wallet.status({
        fulfilmentId
      });

      // Proceed with original transaction
      const signedTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(originalTransaction);
      const result = await wallet.sendTransaction(signedTransaction);
      
      await wallet.respondSessionRequest({
        topic,
        response: formatJsonRpcResult(id, result)
      });
    } else {
      // No bridging required, process transaction normally
      const signedTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(originalTransaction);
      const result = await wallet.sendTransaction(signedTransaction);
      
      await wallet.respondSessionRequest({
        topic,
        response: formatJsonRpcResult(id, result)
      });
    }
  }
});
```

## Types

Following are the types that are used in the chain abstraction methods.

```typescript
namespace ChainAbstractionTypes {
  type FundingFrom = {
    tokenContract: string;
    amount: string;
    chainId: string;
    symbol: string;
  };

  type Transaction = {
    from: string;
    to: string;
    value: string;
    chainId: string;
    gas?: string;
    gasPrice?: string;
    data?: string;
    nonce?: string;
    maxFeePerGas?: string;
    maxPriorityFeePerGas?: string;
  };

  type CanFulfilResponse =
    | {
        status: "not_required";
      }
    | {
        status: "available";
        data: {
          fulfilmentId: string;
          checkIn: number;
          transactions: Transaction[];
          funding: FundingFrom[];
        };
      }
    | {
        status: "error";
        reason: string; // reason can be insufficientFunds | insufficientGasFunds | noRoutesAvailable
      };

  type FulfilmentStatusResponse = {
    createdAt: number;
  } & (
    | {
        status: "completed";
      }
    | { status: "pending"; checkIn: number }
  );
}
```

For example, check out implementation of chain abstraction in [sample wallet](https://github.com/reown-com/react-native-examples/pull/185) with React Native CLI. 

## Testing 

To test Chain Abstraction, you can use the [AppKit laboratory](https://appkit-lab.reown.com/library/wagmi/) and try sending USDC with any chain abstraction supported wallet. 
You can also use this [sample wallet](https://appdistribution.firebase.google.com/testerapps/1:222905275039:android:799d1c9291d92ebe8c88aa/releases/7tkfoelis7n08) for testing.
