# Gas Abstraction for EOAs (experimental)

Gas Abstraction enables existing EOA accounts to execute transactions without needing to have special tokens to pay for the transaction gas; for example ETH on Ethereum. This solution provides wallet developers with a toolkit to integrate gas abstraction using WalletKit.

## How it works

When your wallet receives a `wallet_sendTransaction` request, the wallet will automatically sponsor the transaction for the user using the Reown paymaster.

This works by upgrading the EOA to a smart account that supports paymasters and sending a sponsored User Operation. Specifically, a 7579 modular Safe smart account is deployed and delegated to in a 7702 transaction. The smart account has the same address as the EOA, and the EOA is the only signer on the account.

## FAQ

### What are the available networks for Gas Abstraction?

Gas Abstraction is currently available on any network where 4337 bundlers and paymasters are available.

### What types of paymasters are supported?

Only sponsoring paymasters are supported (by default the Reown paymaster). ERC-20 paymasters are not yet supported.

### What are the limitations?

- Accounts that already have 7702 delegations will be rejected and are not supported.
- Because delegation cannot be removed (only changed), the account will need to indefinitely support EIP-1271 signature creation & validation. This is because apps assume if an account has code, that it is a smart account and it will use EIP-1271 to validate the signature.

### What apps does this support?

Any app that supports smart contract accounts. Specifically, EIP-1271 must now be used for signing.
