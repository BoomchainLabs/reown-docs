# Chain Abstraction

Chain Abstraction enables users with stablecoins on any network to spend on-the-fly on a different network. 
Our Chain Abstraction solution provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate this complex functionality using WalletKit.

## How it works

The application first sends `wallet_sendTransaction` for an ERC-20 transfer to the wallet. Let's say in our case it's USDC. 
The wallet enables the users to complete the transaction with the available tokens from other networks. 
The user approves the transaction and the transaction completes within seconds. 

The diagram below shows an example scenario where a user is interacting with an app and is asked to transfer 225 USDC to the app on Polygon Network. 
The user does not have any USDC on Polygon Network, but their wallet seamlessly allows them to source the funds from other networks.
