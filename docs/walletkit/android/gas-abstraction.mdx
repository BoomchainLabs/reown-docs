# Gas Abstraction (experimental)

WalletKit provides a toolkit for wallet developers to integrate gas abstraction into their wallets.

`GasAbstractionClient` is instantiated with some basic RPC URL and API key information.

When receiving a transaction request, send the transaction to the `prepare_gas_abstraction(txn)` method. This will do some thinking and will prepare a set of operations and return a couple of hashes to be signed.

The operations are:

1. Deploying the 7702 account and delegating to it
2. Sending a sponsored UserOperation for the initial transaction.

The user will then approve signatures for these transactions and the wallet will then call `execute_transaction(txn, signatures)` with the same initial transaction and the signatures.

The function will send the transactions and return status information of them to you.

The below is an example psudo-Rust code of the usage of `GasAbstractionClient`:

```rust
async fn main() {
    let eoa = LocalSigner::random();
    let client = GasAbstractionClient::new(...);
    let txn = Transaction { to: vitalik.eth, amount: 1 ETH };

    let PreparedGasAbstraction {
        hashes_to_sign,
        fields
    } = client.prepare_gas_abstraction(txn).await?;

    ask_user_for_approval(fields).await?;

    let signatures = hashes_to_sign.iter().map(|hash| account.sign(hash)).collect();

    let receipt = client.execute_transaction(txn, Params {
        signatures
    }).await?;

    display_success(receipt)
}
```

```rust
impl GasAbstractionClient {
    async fn new(rpc_url: Url, bundler_url: Url, paymaster_url: Url) -> Self;
    async fn bool prepare_gas_abstraction(Transaction transaction) -> PreparedGasAbstraction;
    async fn bool execute_transaction(Transaction transaction, params: Params) -> B256;
    async fn ..... COPY signature creation functions from current SDK
}

enum PreparedGasAbstraction {
    hashes_to_sign: Vec<B256>,
    fees: GasAbstractionFees, // similar to RouteUiFields -> fee and other UI info for user display
}

enum Params {
    /// EOA signatures by the transaction's sender of `hashes_to_sign`
    signatures: Vec<Signature>,
}
```
