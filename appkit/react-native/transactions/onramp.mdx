title: On-Ramp
---

Enable users to purchase crypto with fiat directly within your React Native app using AppKit's On-Ramp feature. This integration allows users to securely access over 100 cryptocurrencies and purchase tokens to support in-app activity and transactions across multiple chains.

## Configuration

The On-Ramp feature is enabled by default in AppKit. Here's how to configure it in your app:

```typescript
import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit...'; // Ensure this import path is correct for your project

createAppKit({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  // ... other config options
  features: {
    onramp: true, // Optional - true by default
  }
});
```

If you want to disable the On-Ramp feature, you can set `onramp: false` in the features configuration.

## Usage

### Opening the On-Ramp View

You can programmatically open the On-Ramp view using the `useAppKit` hook:

```typescript
import { useAppKit } from '@reown/appkit-...'; // Ensure this import path is correct for your project

function OnRampButton() {
  const { open } = useAppKit();

  const handleOnRampPress = () => {
    open({ view: 'OnRamp' });
  };

  return (
    <Button
      title="Buy Crypto"
      onPress={handleOnRampPress}
    />
  );
}
```

### User Flow

1. When users tap the "Buy Crypto" button or select it from the account view, they'll be presented with the On-Ramp interface.

2. In the On-Ramp interface, users can:
   - Select the fiat currency they want to use
   - Select the cryptocurrency they want to purchase
   - Enter the amount they want to purchase
   - Choose a payment method (e.g., credit card, bank transfer)
   - Review the transaction details including fees and exchange rates

3. After reviewing the transaction details, users can confirm the purchase.

4. Once confirmed, the transaction will be processed, and the cryptocurrency will be added to their wallet.
