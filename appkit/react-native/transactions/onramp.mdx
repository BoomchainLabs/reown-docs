title: On-Ramp
---

Enable users to purchase cryptocurrency with traditional currency (fiat) directly within your React Native app using AppKit's On-Ramp feature. This integration provides secure access to over 100 cryptocurrencies, allowing users to purchase tokens to support in-app activities and transactions across multiple blockchain networks.

## Configuration

The On-Ramp feature is enabled by default in AppKit. Configure it in your application as follows:

```typescript {4-6}
createAppKit({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  // ... other config options
  features: {
    onramp: true, // Optional - true by default
  }
});
```

To disable the On-Ramp feature, set `onramp: false` in the features configuration.

## Usage

### Opening the On-Ramp View

Programmatically open the On-Ramp view using the `useAppKit` hook:

```typescript {2, 5}
function OnRampButton() {
  const { open } = useAppKit();

  const handleOnRampPress = () => {
    open({ view: 'OnRamp' });
  };

  return (
    <Button
      title="Buy Crypto"
      onPress={handleOnRampPress}
    />
  );
}
```

### User Flow

1. When users tap the "Buy Crypto" button or select it from the account view, the On-Ramp interface opens.

2. In the On-Ramp interface, users can:
   - Select their preferred fiat currency (traditional currency like USD, EUR)
   - Choose the cryptocurrency to purchase
   - Enter the purchase amount
   - Select a payment method (credit card, bank transfer, etc.)
   - Review transaction details including fees and exchange rates

3. After reviewing the transaction details, users are redirected to the payment provider's platform to complete the purchase.

4. Once the transaction is confirmed, it will be processed and the cryptocurrency will be added to their wallet.
