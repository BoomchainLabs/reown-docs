title: Swaps
---

Enable users to swap cryptocurrencies directly within your React Native app using AppKit's Swaps feature. This integration provides secure trading between a wide variety of tokens across multiple blockchain networks.

## Configuration

The Swaps feature is enabled by default in AppKit. Configure it in your application as follows:

```typescript {4-6}
createAppKit({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  // ... other config options
  features: {
    swaps: true, // Optional - true by default
  }
});
```

To disable the Swaps feature, set `swaps: false` in the features configuration.

## Usage

### Opening the Swaps View

Programmatically open the Swaps view using the `useAppKit` hook:

```typescript {2, 5}
function SwapButton() {
  const { open } = useAppKit();

  const handleSwapPress = () => {
    open({ view: 'Swap' });
  };

  return (
    <Button
      title="Swap Tokens"
      onPress={handleSwapPress}
    />
  );
}
```

### User Flow

1. When users tap the "Swap Tokens" button or select it from the account view, the Swaps interface opens.

2. In the Swaps interface, users can:
   - Select the source token to swap from
   - Select the destination token to swap to
   - Enter the swap amount
   - Review transaction details including:
     - Price impact (how the trade affects the token price)
     - Network cost (blockchain transaction fees)
     - Slippage tolerance (acceptable price variation during execution)
     - Provider fee (service fee charged by the swap provider)

3. After reviewing the transaction details, users can confirm the swap.

4. Once confirmed, the transaction will be processed and the tokens will be exchanged in their wallet.
