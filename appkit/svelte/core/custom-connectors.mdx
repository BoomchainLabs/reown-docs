title: Custom Connectors
---

By default, [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) and WC connectors are provided out of the box.

```ts
import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit'
import { WagmiAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi'

import { http, WagmiProvider, CreateConnectorFn } from 'wagmi'
import { arbitrum } from '@reown/appkit/networks'
import { abstractWalletConnector } from "@abstract-foundation/agw-react/connectors";

const projectId = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'

const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  networks: [arbitrum],
  projectId,
  connectors: [
    abstractWalletConnector() as CreateConnectorFn
  ]
})

createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  networks: [arbitrum],
  projectId
})
```
