title: Email & Social Wallets
---

AppKit enables passwordless Web3 onboarding and authentication, allowing your users interact with your application by creating a non-custodial wallet with just their emails or social accounts.

<Warning>
Remember to whitelist your dapp's iOS's bundleId and Android's packageName in your cloud configuration.

1. LogIn into https://cloud.reown.com
2. Open Dashboard and scroll down to _Mobile Application IDs_ menu
3. Add your iOS Bundle ID and your Android Package Name
</Warning>

<Note>
Email and Social login are supported only on EVM networks and Solana.
</Note>

## Integration

In order to support Email and Social Wallets creation just set `featuresConfig:` parameter in `ReownAppKitModal` initialization.

```javascript {14-27}
final _appKitModal = ReownAppKitModal(
  context: context,
  projectId: '{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}',
  metadata: const PairingMetadata(
    name: 'Example App',
    description: 'Example app description',
    url: 'https://example.com/',
    icons: ['https://example.com/logo.png'],
    redirect: Redirect(
      native: 'exampleapp://',
      universal: 'https://reown.com/exampleapp',
    ),
  ),
  featuresConfig: FeaturesConfig(
    socials: [
      AppKitSocialOption.Email,
      AppKitSocialOption.X,
      AppKitSocialOption.Google,
      AppKitSocialOption.Apple,
      AppKitSocialOption.Discord,
      AppKitSocialOption.GitHub,
      AppKitSocialOption.Facebook,
      AppKitSocialOption.Twitch,
      AppKitSocialOption.Telegram,
    ],
    showMainWallets: false, // OPTIONAL - true by default
  ),
);
```

## Options

- **_socials `List<AppKitSocialOption>`_** : This list contains the list of social platforms that you want to enable for user authentication. Is empty by default, it means that no social options is enabled. The buttons in the modal will be shown in the same order you configure the list.
- **_showMainWallets `bool`_** : This boolean defines whether you want to show the main wallet options on the first connect screen. If this is `false` it will show a button that directs you to a new screen displaying all available wallets. Default `true`.

<Info>
In order for Farcaster to work properly, either `AppKitModalConnectButton()` or `AppKitModalAccountButton()` has to be instantiated during the whole lifetime of the app.

If you already use them then nothing else has to be done, but in case you don't use them but still want to support Email & Social Wallets you would have to instantiate and hide them as follows:

```javascript
AppKitModalConnectButton(
  appKit: _appKitModal,
  custom: SizedBox.shrink(), // Will make the button invisible
),
AppKitModalAccountButton(
  appKit: _appKitModal,
  custom: SizedBox.shrink(), // Will make the button invisible
),
```
</Info>

## User Flow

1. Users will be able to connect to you application by simply using an email address or a social option. When selecting an option, the user will be redirected to a secure-site's login in the device's default browser. When using Email option, AppKit will send first an approve link to your email and then a One Time Password (OTP) to use in the login flow, which will help to verify the user's authenticity. In any case, Email and Social options will create a non-custodial wallet for your user which will be available in any application that integrates AppKit and Email Wallets.

2. Eventually the user can optionally choose to move from a non-custodial wallet to a self-custodial one by pressing "Upgrade Wallet" on AppKit. This will open the Reown secure website that will walk your user through the upgrading process.
