**AppKit Pay with Exchange** unlocks a powerful new flow: users can pay in crypto directly from their Centralized Exchange (CEXs) accounts like Binance or Coinbase, with no new wallets, no app switching, and no lost conversions.

## Quick Start  
Here you can find a simplify process to integrate AppKit Pay with Javascript SDK:

### Install the library

<Warning>
    Projects first need to install and set up Reown AppKit before integrating AppKit Pay. If you haven't done so, please refer to the [Reown AppKit docs](/appkit/overview#quickstart).
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Yarn
yarn add @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash Bun
bun a @reown/appkit-pay
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @reown/appkit-pay
```
</CodeGroup>

### Usage
```ts
import { usePay } from '@reown/appkit-pay';
```

In order to run the payment, we are using the function `openPay`. 

```ts
const paymentAssetDetails = {
  network: 'eip155:8453', // e.g., Base Mainnet
  asset: 'native', // or '0xTokenAddress...'
  metadata: { name: 'Ethereum', symbol: 'ETH', decimals: 18 }
};

// --- Open Modal ---
await openPay({
    recipient: '0xYourRecipientAddress...',
    amount: 0.001,
    paymentAsset: paymentAssetDetails
});
```
