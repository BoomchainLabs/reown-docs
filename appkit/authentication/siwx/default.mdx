sidebarTitle: Multichain Authentication (SIWX)
---

The **Sign In With X** feature enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to authenticate users seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin, since this feature is **chain agnostic**.

This feature allows developers using our SDK to implement authentication by having users sign a unique string message with their blockchain wallets. The **Sign In With X** feature is designed in accordance with the [CAIP-122](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-122.md) standard, which establishes a chain-agnostic framework for blockchain-based authentication and authorization on off-chain services.

## Getting Started

**SIWX** works as a plugin system for AppKit and you are going to add the plugin in the AppKit configuration. There are some ways to implement the **SIWX** feature:

- Use Reown Authentication to manage the sessions in the Cloud Dashboard
- Use the `DefaultSIWX` class provided by AppKit
- Create a custom implementation to suit your specific requirements.

To initialize the **SIWX** feature, you need to add the `siwx` parameter to the `createAppKit` function.

### Reown Authentication

**Reown Authentication is our flagship SIWX (Sign In With X) solution** - the recommended way to handle user authentication for modern web3 applications. Built specifically for multi-chain environments, it abstracts away the complexity of validating wallets across **EVM, Solana, and Bitcoin networks**.

Read more about the [Reown Authentication Implementation](./reown-authentication).

### DefaultSIWX

`DefaultSIWX` is a scaffold implementation of the SIWX feature for quick integration. This option provides a set of pre-built components that allow you to have the feature up and running in no time.

Read more about the [DefaultSIWX Implementation](./siwx-default).

### Custom Implementation

The `siwx` param expects to receive a defined interface from which you are able to create your own implementation. This is what allows you to customize the feature to suit your specific requirements.

The defined interface must follow specific rules to make sure that AppKit can interact with it correctly. Read more about how to have your [Custom Implementation](./siwx-custom).

## SIWX Expected Behavior

- **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity every time a connection happen;
- In case a SIWX session is already stored, the user will be automatically signed in and the prompt step will be skipped;
- If the user changes the connected network, **SIWX** will prompt to get the user signature and verify his identity again;
- If the user disconnects from the Dapp, **SIWX** will revoke the session and the user will need to sign in again.

## Migrating from SIWE to SIWX

If you are currently already using **SIWE** from `@reown/appkit-siwe`, after AppKit version 1.5.0, you will be migrated into **SIWX**. The migration process is automatic and your `siweConfig` from `createAppKit` function will be mapped internally.

<Warning>
It is important to note that you cannot use `siweConfig` and `siwx` at the same time, `createAppKit` will throw an error in case this happens.

You may replace `siweConfig` with your own `siwx` configuration manually if you would like to do so.

</Warning>
