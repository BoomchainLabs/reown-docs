Chain Abstraction is a feature in Reown AppKit that enables dApps to facilitate seamless cross-chain transactions for users. It allows users to spend assets, such as stablecoins, across different blockchain networks without needing to manually bridge tokens, worry about network-specific tokens, or manage multiple wallets.
