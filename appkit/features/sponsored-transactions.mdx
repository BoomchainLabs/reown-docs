title: Sponsored Transactions
---

Sponsored transactions is an umbrella term for multiple methods of utilizing
[ERC 7677](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677) paymasters that allow a dapp
to cover the gas fees for the transaction of a wallet.

This approach simplifies blockchain interactions by enabling users to perform
actions without directly handling transaction fees, which are instead paid by
the dApp. This concept is particularly beneficial for attracting new users, as
it removes the need to understand complex wallet mechanics or hold
cryptocurrency for gas fees, making the overall experience more intuitive and
accessible.
