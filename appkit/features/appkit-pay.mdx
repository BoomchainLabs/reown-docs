AppKit Pay enables seamless crypto payments by supporting a wide range of wallet types, including non-custodial wallets, as well as custodial platforms like Binance and Coinbase. 
This flexibility allows users to complete transactions using their preferred method—whether it's a traditional wallet or directly from their exchange account—without disrupting the on-chain payment flow.

This feature improves user experience by reducing friction at checkout and meeting end users where they already hold their crypto, making crypto payments more accessible and conversion-friendly.
