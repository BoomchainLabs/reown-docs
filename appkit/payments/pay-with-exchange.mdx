title: Pay with Exchange & Self-Custodial Wallets
---

**AppKit Pay with Exchange** unlocks a powerful new flow: users can pay in crypto directly from their **Centralized Exchange (CEXs) accounts** like Binance or Coinbase, **with no new wallets, no app switching, and no lost conversions.** This flow is bundled together with the **Pay with Self Custodial Wallets** flow.

This feature brings together Reown's vast ecosystem of wallets and onchain infrastructure to offer:

- **Fewer clicks, higher conversion**: Seamless checkout within the Centralized Exchange (CEX) UI.

- **No credentials shared**: Secure flow with no handling of user login, credentials, or private keys.

- **Instant integration for PSPs**: Payments settle onchain, using existing reconciliation systems.

- **Fallback-friendly**: If the exchange balance is low, users can onramp and complete payment in the same flow.

With **72% of crypto users holding funds on exchanges**, **Pay with Exchange** helps payment providers tap into where users actually keep their assets and turn more intent into successful transactions.

***A direct integration from CEX to checkout. No wallet needed, no friction, and no compromises***
