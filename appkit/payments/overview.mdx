It powers modern payment experiences like:

1. **Pay with Exchange**: Let users pay directly from Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and more.

2. **1-Click Checkout**: Fast, mobile-optimized, self-custodial and crypto native checkout flows (coming soon).

3. **Subscriptions & Recurring Payments**: Enable recurring payments and subscriptions with onchain with the best UX practices.

With **multi-platform SDKs**, **battle-tested infrastructure**, and **exclusive analytics**, AppKit Pay helps payment providers reduce integration time, improve conversion, and stay ahead of the competitionâ€”without building from scratch.

***One integration. Infinite reach. Real crypto payments, done right.***
