## Try AppKit Notifications

The fastest way to try AppKit Notifications is to go to [app.web3inbox.com](https://app.web3inbox.com) and try subscribing to some dapps. The [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com) is a universal inbox for web3 users to access all their notifications in one place.

- [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com)

Or access the repo at [github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3inbox/).

## Native notifications

AppKit Notifications also supports native notifications on iOS and Android. To try native notifications, you can use the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com) and subscribe to dapps or build one of our sample apps.

A wallet that supports Notify is required to receive notifications.

## Wallet notifications

To try wallet notifications on a iOS or Android device, use a wallet that supports Notify. Alternatively, try building one of our sample apps, or grab a sample wallet preview build from Testflight or Firebase.
