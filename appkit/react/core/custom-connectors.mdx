title: Custom connectors
---

In AppKit, a 'connector' is the bridge between your app and a user's wallet. This page shows how to add custom connectors beyond the default ones, allowing your users to connect with additional wallet types and authentication methods.

<Tab title="Wagmi">

If you already have Wagmi integrated into your application or would like more control over Wagmi's configuration, you can integrate AppKit on top of it.

Adding custom connectors like WalletConnect and Coinbase is optional.

By default, [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) and WC connectors are provided out of the box.

```tsx
import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/react'
import { WagmiAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi'

import { http, WagmiProvider, CreateConnectorFn } from 'wagmi'
import { sepolia } from '@reown/appkit/networks'
import { walletConnect, coinbaseWallet, injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

const projectId = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'

const metadata = {
  //...
}

// create the connectors (delete the ones you don't need)
const connectors: CreateConnectorFn[] = []
connectors.push(walletConnect({ projectId, metadata, showQrModal: false })) // showQrModal must be false
connectors.push(injected({ shimDisconnect: true }))
connectors.push(
  coinbaseWallet({
    appName: metadata.name,
    appLogoUrl: metadata.icons[0]
  })
)

export const networks = [sepolia]

export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  transports: {
    [sepolia.id]: http()
  },
  connectors,
  projectId,
  networks
})

export const config = wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig

createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  projectId,
  networks: [sepolia]
})

export function ContextProvider({ children }) {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  )
}
```
