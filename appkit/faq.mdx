## Error: Invalid App Configuration

<img src="/images/faq/invalidAppConfiguration.png" />

This is a very common error that happens mainly when you didn't make a correct setup of the projectId. Please create and use a valid projectid from https://cloud.reown.com/

```javascript
const modal = createAppKit({
  ...
  projectId: "..." // add a valid projectId 
});
```

## No wallets are visible, only the title "Connect Wallet."

Problem: After clicking in the connect button users are only seeing the modal with the title "Connect Wallet".

Solution: In general there are two possibilities for this error.

1. Check all the libraries from @reown are using the **same version** in the packages.json.

``` json
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@reown/appkit": "1.7.8",
    "@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi": "1.7.8",
    ...
  }
```

2. The `createAppKit` call must be outside the component in order to work correctly.

```javascript
// Create modal
createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  ...generalConfig,
  features: {
    analytics: true // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration
  }
})

export function App() {
  return (
     <WagmiProvider ...>
        <QueryClientProvider ...>
          <appkit-button />
        </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
}

```

## When will reown supports off-ramp?

For the moment, Reown do not have plans to do off-ramp.

## How can i retrieve more than one address from the currently connected wallets?

To resolve this issue, please refer to our multichain example:

- https://appkit-web-examples-react-multichain.reown.com/

- https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/react/react-multichain

These are some code snippets for React SDK:

``` javascript
import { useAppKitAccount } from '@reown/appkit/react'
const eip155AccountState = useAppKitAccount({ namespace: 'eip155' })
const solanaAccountState = useAppKitAccount({ namespace: 'solana' })
```

``` javascript
<>
  Address EVM : {eip155AccountState.address}<br />
  Addresss Solana: {solanaAccountState.address}<br />
</>
```

## How to hide UX by reown ?

Currently, only enterprise clients can hide "UX by reown" in our modal by adjusting this option on our Dashboard.
