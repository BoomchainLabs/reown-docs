## Error: Invalid App Configuration

<img src="/images/faq/invalidAppConfiguration.png" />

This is a very common error that happens mainly when you did not set up the `projectId` correctly. Please create and use a valid projectId from https://cloud.reown.com/

```javascript
const modal = createAppKit({
  ...
  projectId: "..." // add a valid projectId 
});
```

## No wallets are visible, only the title "Connect Wallet."

Problem: After clicking the connect button users are only seeing the modal with the title "Connect Wallet".

Solution: In general there are two possibilities for this error.

1. Check all the libraries from @reown are using the **same version** in `packages.json`.

``` json
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@reown/appkit": "1.7.8",
    "@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi": "1.7.8",
    ...
  }
```

2. Call `createAppKit` outside of the component to ensure correct behavior.".

```javascript
// Create modal
createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  ...generalConfig,
  features: {
    analytics: true // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration
  }
})

export function App() {
  return (
     <WagmiProvider ...>
        <QueryClientProvider ...>
          <appkit-button />
        </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
}

```

## When will Reown support off-ramp?

For the moment, Reown does not currently plan to support off-ramp.

## How can I retrieve more than one address from the currently connected wallets?

To resolve this issue, please refer to our multichain example:

- https://appkit-web-examples-react-multichain.reown.com/

- https://github.com/reown-com/appkit-web-examples/tree/main/react/react-multichain

These are some code snippets for React SDK:

``` javascript
import { useAppKitAccount } from '@reown/appkit/react'
const eip155AccountState = useAppKitAccount({ namespace: 'eip155' })
const solanaAccountState = useAppKitAccount({ namespace: 'solana' })
```

``` javascript
<>
  Address EVM : {eip155AccountState.address}<br />
  Address Solana: {solanaAccountState.address}<br />
</>
```

## How can I hide `UX by Reown`?

Currently, only enterprise clients can hide "UX by reown" in our modal by adjusting this option on our Dashboard.

## Do I need to wait for my dApp approval before using it, as it is still in "Pending Review"?

No, dApps do not need approval in order to use your projectId. 

## Can `createAppKit` be lazily initialized and torn down for re-initialization with a different network configuration?

A: Currently, `createAppKit` can only be called once during the application's lifecycle. 
It cannot be lazily initialized and then torn down for re-initialization. 
This means you must pass in all the networks you plan to support during the initial setup.

## Can we use our own RPC in APPkit?
A: Yes, you can use your own RPC by setting the customRpcUrls option in the APPkit configuration. This lets you define custom RPC URLs for specific chains. Each entry must follow the format:

``` javascript
customRpcUrls: {
  [ChainId.Ethereum]: 'https://your.custom.rpc.url',
  [ChainId.Polygon]: 'https://your.polygon.rpc.url',
}
```

APPkit will prioritize these URLs over the default ones.
