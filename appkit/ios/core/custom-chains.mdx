## Custom Chain Selection

You can add your own chain to extend default set of chain presets by calling the `addChainPreset(_ chain: Chain)` static method on the `AppKit` object.

<Note>
If you modify the presets, it will be reflected in the `AppKitNetworkButton` button and Network selection screens.
</Note>

<Info>
The chain must be EVM compatible
